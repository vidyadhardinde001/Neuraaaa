# Multi-Tab File Manager Features

## 🎯 What's New

Your file manager now supports multiple tabs and drag-and-drop functionality, similar to Windows File Explorer!

## 📑 Tab Features

### Opening Tabs
- **New Tab**: Click the **➕** button at the end of the tab bar
- Each tab maintains its own folder path, history, and navigation state

### Managing Tabs
- **Switch Tabs**: Click on any tab to switch between them
- **Close Tab**: Click the ✕ button on a tab to close it
- **Rename Tab**: Right-click on a tab to rename it (useful for organizing multiple locations)
- **Save Tab Name**: Press Enter to save or Esc to cancel

### Tab Benefits
- Open multiple folders simultaneously
- Independent back/forward history for each tab
- Each tab maintains its own search/filter state
- Quickly switch between different directories without losing your place

## 🎨 Drag and Drop

### Dragging Files/Folders
1. **Click and drag** any file or folder from the file list
2. The item will become **semi-transparent** while dragging
3. **Hover visual feedback** shows where you can drop

### Drop Zones
- Drag and drop files/folders between tabs
- Drag files to the drag-drop zone in the main viewing area
- Files show a **blue highlight and dashed border** when you drag over them

### Usage Tips
- Dragging works with both files and folders
- You can drag items between different tabs
- The file path is preserved during drag operations
- Use right-click context menu for copy/move options

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Tab Navigation**: Use mouse to click tabs (keyboard shortcuts coming soon)
- **Rename Tab**: Right-click on tab name
- **New Tab**: Click the ➕ button

## 🔄 How Tabs Work with Navigation

Each tab has its own:
- Current folder path
- Navigation history (back/forward buttons work independently)
- Search results
- File selection

### Example Workflow
1. Open Tab 1: `C:\Documents`
2. Click ➕ to open Tab 2 (starts at Home)
3. Navigate Tab 2 to `D:\Photos`
4. Switch back to Tab 1 - you're still in `C:\Documents`
5. Use back/forward buttons - only affects the current tab

## 💡 Pro Tips

- Right-click a tab to rename it to something memorable (e.g., "Project A", "Downloads")
- Use multiple tabs to compare folder contents side-by-side
- Each tab remembers your scroll position and selections
- Closing the application saves your tab state (restored on next launch)

## 🎁 Features Coming Soon

- Drag and drop between multiple windows
- Tab grouping and color coding
- Keyboard shortcuts for tab switching (Ctrl+Tab, Ctrl+Shift+Tab)
- Save tab layouts for quick access
